I have run tests on the following types of files:
text files of multiple sizes:
	- three randomly generated ascii files of differing sizes (1KB, 1MB, 1GB) (because there are so few repeating characters, the 'compressed' file is actually larger)
	- two binary files
	- the test.txt file provided by Tino for a sample test case
	- an output file for my encoding program
	- the example dictionary provided to us by Tino
